 # Teacher Access Control Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive teacher access control system implemented for the School Management System API. The system ensures that teachers can only access data for students and subjects they are assigned to teach.

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **TeacherAssignment Model**: Added to track which teacher teaches which subject in which subclass
- **Proper Relationships**: Connected teachers, subjects, subclasses, and academic years
- **Migration Created**: Database migration `add_teacher_assignments` successfully applied

### 2. Teacher-Specific API Endpoints

#### **GET /teachers/me/subjects**
Returns subjects that the authenticated teacher is assigned to teach:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Mathematics",
      "category": "SCIENCE",
      "subClasses": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Form 1A",
          "classId": 1,
          "className": "Form 1",
          "coefficient": 4,
          "periodsPerWeek": 5,
          "studentCount": 30
        }
      ],
      "totalStudents": 120,
      "totalPeriods": 20
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **GET /teachers/me/students**
Returns students from subclasses where the teacher has assignments:
- Supports pagination and filtering
- Only shows students from teacher's assigned subclasses
- Includes which subjects the teacher teaches each student

#### **GET /teachers/me/subclasses**
Returns subclasses where the teacher has at least one subject assignment:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Form 1A",
      "class": { "id": 1, "name": "Form 1" },
      "subjects": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Mathematics",
          "coefficient": 4,
          "periodsPerWeek": 5
        }
      ],
      "studentCount": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **GET /teachers/me/dashboard**
Teacher-specific dashboard with teaching statistics and upcoming tasks.

#### **GET /teachers/me/access-check**
Validates teacher access to specific subject/subclass combinations.

#### **GET /teachers/me/subject-ids**
Returns array of subject IDs the teacher can access.

#### **GET /teachers/me/subclass-ids**
Returns array of subclass IDs the teacher can access.

### 3. Enhanced Existing Endpoints with Access Control

#### **Marks Endpoints** (`/marks`)
- **GET /marks**: Teachers can only view marks for their assigned subjects/subclasses
- **POST /marks**: Teachers can only create marks for their assigned subjects/subclasses
- **PUT /marks/:id**: Teachers can only update marks for their assigned subjects/subclasses
- **DELETE /marks/:id**: Teachers can only delete marks for their assigned subjects/subclasses

#### **Student Endpoints** (`/students`)
- **GET /students**: Teachers can only view students from their assigned subclasses
- **GET /students/:id**: Teachers can only view students they have access to
- **GET /students/status/summary**: Filtered to teacher's assigned students
- **GET /students/:id/status**: Access controlled for teachers
- **GET /students/:studentId/parents**: Access controlled for teachers

### 4. Authorization Middleware

#### **Teacher Role Validation**
```typescript
export const requireTeacherRole = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Validates user has TEACHER role
}
```

#### **Subject/SubClass Access Validation**
```typescript
export const validateTeacherSubjectAccess = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Validates teacher can access specific subject/subclass
}
```

#### **Student Access Validation**
```typescript
export const validateTeacherStudentAccess = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Validates teacher can access specific students
}
```

#### **Marks Access Validation**
```typescript
export const validateTeacherMarksAccess = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Validates teacher can enter/modify marks for specific subjects
}
```

### 5. Service Layer Implementation

#### **Core Access Functions**
- `hasTeacherAccess(teacherId, subjectId?, subClassId?, academicYearId?)`: Checks access
- `getTeacherSubjects(teacherId, academicYearId?)`: Gets assigned subjects
- `getTeacherStudents(teacherId, filters, pagination)`: Gets accessible students
- `getTeacherSubClasses(teacherId, academicYearId?)`: Gets assigned subclasses
- `getTeacherSubjectIds(teacherId, academicYearId?)`: Gets accessible subject IDs
- `getTeacherSubClassIds(teacherId, academicYearId?)`: Gets accessible subclass IDs

### 6. Academic Year Context Support
- All functions support academic year filtering
- Defaults to current academic year when not specified
- Handles academic year transitions properly

### 7. Sample Data and Testing
- **Teacher Assignments Script**: Created `scripts/create-teacher-assignments.ts`
- **Sample Data**: Successfully created test teacher assignments:
  - Teacher One: Mathematics in multiple classes, Physics for science classes
  - Teacher Two: English Language and Literature across various classes
- **Database Migration**: Applied successfully with seed data

### 8. API Documentation
- **Comprehensive Swagger Docs**: Created detailed API documentation in `teacherDocs.ts`
- **Request/Response Examples**: Provided for all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Documented error responses and status codes
- **Authentication**: Documented security requirements

## üîê Security Implementation

### Access Control Levels
1. **Authentication**: JWT token required for all endpoints
2. **Role Authorization**: TEACHER role required for teacher-specific endpoints
3. **Assignment Validation**: Teachers can only access their assigned data
4. **Academic Year Context**: Proper filtering by academic year

### Middleware Chain Example
```typescript
router.get('/marks', 
  authenticate,                    // 1. Verify JWT token
  authorize(['TEACHER']),          // 2. Check TEACHER role
  validateTeacherSubjectAccess,    // 3. Validate subject access
  examController.getAllMarks       // 4. Execute controller
);
```

### Conditional Access Control
For endpoints used by multiple roles, conditional access control is applied:
```typescript
// Only apply teacher restrictions for TEACHER role users
if (isTeacher && !hasHigherRole) {
  return validateTeacherSubjectAccess(req, res, next);
}
```

## üìä Data Flow

### Teacher Assignment Flow
1. **Admin creates teacher assignments** via `TeacherAssignment` model
2. **Teacher logs in** and receives JWT token with role information
3. **Teacher accesses endpoint** with authentication
4. **Middleware validates** teacher's assignment to requested data
5. **Service layer filters** data based on teacher's assignments
6. **Response returns** only accessible data

### Query Optimization
- Uses efficient Prisma queries with proper includes
- Filters at database level, not application level
- Supports pagination for large datasets
- Includes student counts and aggregate data

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Get teacher's subjects
const subjects = await fetch('/api/v1/teachers/me/subjects', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Get teacher's students with pagination
const students = await fetch('/api/v1/teachers/me/students?page=1&limit=20', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Check access before making marks request
const hasAccess = await fetch('/api/v1/teachers/me/access-check?subjectId=1&subClassId=2', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

### Error Handling
```json
// 403 Forbidden - No access to subject/subclass
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Access denied: You are not assigned to teach this subject in this class"
}

// 404 Not Found - Student not in teacher's classes
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Access denied: This student is not in your assigned classes"
}
```

## üîÑ Academic Year Handling
- All queries default to current academic year
- Explicit academic year can be specified via query parameter
- Handles academic year transitions seamlessly
- Supports historical data access for previous years

## üí° Benefits Achieved

- Secure API design following best practices

## üìù Next Steps for Frontend Implementation

### 1. Update Teacher Pages
- Use new `/teachers/me/*` endpoints instead of general endpoints
- Remove client-side filtering logic
- Implement proper error handling for access denied scenarios

### 2. Teacher Dashboard
- Integrate with `/teachers/me/dashboard` endpoint
- Display teaching statistics and upcoming classes
- Show recent activity and pending tasks

### 3. Student Management
- Use `/teachers/me/students` for student lists
- Filter students by teacher's subclasses automatically
- Show only subjects teacher teaches for each student

### 4. Marks Entry
- Validate access before showing marks entry forms
- Use teacher's subject/subclass assignments to populate dropdowns
- Handle access denied errors gracefully

This implementation provides a complete, secure, and efficient teacher access control system that can be easily integrated with the frontend application.
