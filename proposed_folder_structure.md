# Proposed Folder Structure for School Management System API

This document outlines a proposed folder structure for the school management system API, built with Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## Top-Level Structure

```

├── prisma/              # Prisma schema and migrations
│   ├── migrations/      # Database migration files
│   └── schema.prisma    # Prisma schema definition
├── src/                 # Source code
│   ├── api/             # API specific code

│   ├── app.ts           # Application entry point

## Directory Explanations

*   **`prisma/`**: Contains all Prisma-related files.
    *   `migrations/`: Stores database migration files, tracking changes to the schema over time.
    *   `schema.prisma`: Defines the database schema and models using Prisma's schema language.

*   **`src/`**: Houses the main application source code.
    *   `api/v1/`:
        *   `controllers/`: Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and interacts with services. Each controller typically corresponds to a specific resource or feature (e.g., `usersController.ts`, `coursesController.ts`).
        *   `services/`: Contains the core business logic of the application. Services encapsulate operations related to specific entities or features (e.g., `userService.ts`, `courseService.ts`).
        *   `models/`: This directory will contain files that interact with the Prisma Client. These files will act as an abstraction layer between your services and Prisma, making it easier to manage database interactions. For example, you might have `userModel.ts` with functions like `createUser`, `getUserById`, etc.
        *   `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints and associates them with specific controller actions. Separate route files can be created for different resources (e.g., `userRoutes.ts`, `courseRoutes.ts`).
        *   `middleware/`: Contains custom middleware functions for tasks like authentication, authorization, request logging, and input validation.
        *   `utils/`: Provides utility functions and helper classes that are used across the API version (e.g., date formatting, error handling, string manipulation).
    *   `config/`: Stores configuration files for different environments (development, production, testing) and manages application settings.
    *   `utils/`: Provides utility functions and helper classes that are used across the application (and are not API version specific).
    *   `app.ts`: Sets up the Express application, connects middleware, and defines routes. This is the main entry point for the application.
    *   `server.ts`: Handles server startup and configuration, including setting the port and listening for incoming connections.

*   **`tests/`**: Includes unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

*   **`.env`**: Stores environment-specific variables (e.g., database credentials, API keys). This file should not be committed to version control.

*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).

*   **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts for building, testing, and running the application.

*   **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that locks down the specific versions of installed dependencies, ensuring consistent installations across different environments.

*   **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures the TypeScript compiler, if TypeScript is used.

This structure promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. It's a starting point and can be adjusted based on specific project needs. The `api/v1` structure allows for future API versioning (e.g., `api/v2`) without disrupting existing clients.
